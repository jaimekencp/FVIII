## Goal of this task

This task serves as an example project for data commonly encountered within the 
pharmacometrics literature. Although we rarely encounter data sets of around 
500 subjects 'in the wild', we want to encourage the applicant to be creative.
Importantly, the goal is not to produce the most accurate model given the data, 
but rather to try to find creative ways of dealing with the data and to think 
about the clinical use-case for the model you will be developing.

## Project description

You are tasked by your department to figure out how to deal with high variability 
in drug exposure between the haemophilia A patients in your hospital. At the 
moment, all patients receive a similar dose per kilogram of body weight. Your 
treatment center has spend the last precious years collecting a large data set 
of patients who received a single dose of one of three factor VIII (FVIII) 
concentrates. After the dose, FVIII activity was measured at three time points 
after the dose. Information on patient characteristics is available and the 
clinicians have requested you find out what markers are important determinants of 
low drug exposure or short drug half-life. Your plan is to create a model to 
predict the drug activity levels after the dose, and try to find out how to 
covariates affect the exposure. After you model is completed, you will report 
your findings to the clinicians so that they can make a decision on how they can 
adapt the treatment of these patients for better outcomes. Be mindfull that you 
should produce results that can be interpreted by the clinicians.

## Requirements

Don't worry, we won't force you to write your code in a specific or obscure 
language. Use any language that is most comfortable to you, be it R, Python, or 
Matlab. We do ask the following things:

* Your code should be easy to understand. We often collaborate on projects, and 
it is useful to understand what others did by reading eachother's code. 

* Document your progress and thoughts during the project. Don't just hand in the 
training code; we encourage you to also show your data exploration code, figures, 
and thoughts as you move through model iterations. Tools such as Rmarkdown or 
jupyter can be a nice way to combine code and text.

* Don't spend every ounce of free time you have the coming week on the project. 
Try to aim for roughly 6 hours of work. You are of course welcome to spend more 
time on the project if it interests you; but don't feel like we would expect 
world class performance in terms of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms 
implemented by hand.

## About the data

The data set contains a total of 500 subjects with severe haemophilia A. It 
contains information on measured factor VIII activity levels 
(dv column; unit = IU/mL), the time point of a dose 
(at t = 0; amt column, unit = IU) or measurement, and information on the 
infusion time of each dose (duration column). The mdv column indicates whether 
the current row has a missing value for the dependent variable 
(i.e. mdv = 0 -> measurement taken, mdv = 1 -> dose administered). Several 
covariates are available: subject age (age column), height (ht), weight (wt), 
whether the patient has blood group O (bgo column, 0 = false, 1 = true), 
von Willebrand factor levels (vwf), brandname of FVIII concentrate 
(product column), and the specific FVIII mutation identified to result in the 
disease (mutation).
